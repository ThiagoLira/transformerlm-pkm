 <begin> ash , brock , and aipom are continuing their search for pikachu , now aided by ash's newly-caught starly . meanwhile , dawn , pikachu and piplup are retracing their steps hoping to find ash . ash and brock suddenly notice an electric attack in the distance which they go running towards , thinking it must be pikachu.
however , it turns out that the attack is actually coming from an elekid which is attacking a flock of starly . the elekid's trainer throws a poké ball towards one . however , the starly he throws the ball towards is the one owned by ash and , therefore , the capture fails . as the trainer catches the ball , ash arrives and calls starly to sit on his shoulder before asking the trainer if he's seen dawn and pikachu to which he hasn't . the trainer , who saw ash capture starly , then asks if he's sure the starly he caught is the best one . he then throws three poké balls which all contain a starly each . the trainer then explains that by scanning a pokémon with the pokédex a trainer can see what attacks it knows thereby saving a lot of time and energy in the long run . after scanning the three starly to see which of them know aerial ace , he then returns them all to their poké balls . then , after telling two of the starly to get lost as they're not needed , he throws two of the poké balls which send out the starly with a blue light , signifying their permanent release . ash remarks this is an unusual way to treat pokémon , as he believes any pokémon has the ability to be strong and the trainer challenges ash to a three-on-three battle . unfortunately , ash has to refuse as he only has aipom and starly on him now to which the trainer doesn't take kindly . after calling ash pathetic he takes his elekid and leaves.
before ash can get too angry about the incident , he and brock hear the sound of a volt tackle in the distance . knowing that only pikachu knows that move , the two begin running and the mention of volt tackle catches elekid's trainer's interest . however , dawn , pikachu and piplup are having their own problems as team rocket has reappeared and cornered them with another giant robot . despite piplup's best attempts , team rocket successfully snag pikachu to dawn's horror . with his bubble beam attack not working , piplup charges the mech but is no match and gets knocked out . jessie mocks the fact that piplup is a flightless bird and sends the robot's hands down and almost grabs piplup when aipom and starly burst through the trees and attacks with swift and whirlwind attacks . pikachu and dawn are shocked to see the pokémon . ash realizes team rocket are in the machine . they step out onto a platform in front of it and say their new motto , much to ash's distaste . ash climbs a tree and jumps onto the machine's arm , climbing up to pikachu . dawn is stunned at the lengths he will go to for pikachu , while also very scared for ash at the same time . ash tries to force the hand open and the machine begins to malfunction . brock tells dawn to duck and they do . the robot explodes and team rocket go blasting off.
brock and dawn become worried for ash and pikachu , who are still in the rubble . finally emerging from the rubble , ash , pikachu , aipom , and starly reunite . ash officially introduces pikachu to starly . ash then introduces himself to dawn and scans her piplup with his pokédex . exhausted , piplup collapses . brock takes him in his arms , gives him some potion and he feels better instantly . at a phone booth , the gang makes a call to professor rowan . he reveals that he has a parcel at the lab from ash's mom . in the forest , paul and his elekid examine team rocket's broken robot . ash is tougher than he thought.
walking down the road together , ash , dawn , and brock are approached by officer jenny who is glad ash found his pikachu . at the lab , ash opens his parcel , surprised to find new clothes , a new hat , new shoes , and a new backpack . after putting them on , he calls his mom , telling her he is all right . he also calls professor oak , who chats with rowan . in the living room , dawn asks ash if she could come along with them to which ash agrees . piplup , aipom , and starly are recalled into their poké balls , leading dawn to ask ash why he doesn't place pikachu in his poké ball as well . ash explains that pikachu hates traveling in a poké ball , especially when his shoulder does just fine which amazes dawn . professor rowan explains to dawn that different pokémon have different personalities . it's time for the gang to depart , and ash thanks professor rowan for everything he's done . however , just as they leave ash and brock find paul waiting for them . paul tells ash that now he has three pokémon they can have a battle . ash is now more than happy to accept a challenge from the arrogant trainer , and professor rowan offers them use of his back garden for the battle.
as the two face off , brock offers to act as referee while paul spells out the rules ; it will be a three-on-three battle with no substitutions , the first to reach two wins will get the match . both trainers release their starly . ash starts off by commanding his starly to use quick attack but the opponent manages to dodge it . paul's starly uses aerial ace . ash tries to counter with a wing attack , but paul's starly uses double team followed by another aerial ace and as a result , ash's starly is knocked out . ash recalls starly , as does paul.
ash throws a poké ball and his aipom emerges . paul throws out his chimchar , which ash scans with his pokédex . aipom launches a swift attack , but chimchar counters with ember , and the two attacks explode on contact . aipom prepares to use focus punch , but chimchar uses flame wheel , stopping the attack , as rowan explains focus punch fails if the pokémon is hit when the attack is charging up . aipom uses double team , but an ember destroys all the clones , and the real aipom is slashed by chimchar's claws . ash orders another focus punch , as paul prepares to intercept it , but aipom jumps into the air , dodging the flame wheel . aipom smashes down into chimchar with focus punch , knocking the fire monkey out . the trainers recall their pokémon.
ash then sends out pikachu and paul sends out his elekid . ash starts things off by ordering pikachu to use thunderbolt , but elekid simply absorbs the attack . paul then tells elekid to use thunder . elekid revolves its arms and fires off a huge electric bolt at pikachu , who takes the attack as well . ash then tells pikachu to use volt tackle . paul tells elekid to use protect to stop the attack . pikachu is sent flying back , and dawn wonders why pikachu took damage . professor rowan explains that while volt tackle is a powerful move , it also damages the user.
pikachu gets up however , and ash tells him to use iron tail . while paul orders elekid to counter the move with brick break . pikachu jumps towards elekid , and the two exchange blows for some time , before elekid manages to land a thunder punch attack . however , the strain of the battle takes its toll on both pokémon , and pikachu and elekid fall down at the same time , defeated . brock announces that the battle was a tie , and that the whole three-on-three battle was also a tie , with both trainers with one win , one loss and a draw . ash takes pikachu into his arms , telling his partner that as he was the first to go down ash considers it a loss , however paul walks over to him and says that as it was called a draw , a draw is what it is . then paul pulls a poké ball from his belt and releases his last remaining starly . ash asks what he did that for , and paul tells him that there will be other starly even stronger than this one . he then bows to professor rowan , before walking off . ash stares at him angry on seeing such disrespect to pokémon.
and so , having made a new friend and a new rival , ash and pikachu prepare for their adventures in sinnoh , not knowing what awaits them <end>
